    William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consist of 154 poems, each fourteen lines long (three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Quatrain">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Couplet">Couplet</a>).
    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Shall i compare thee to a summer's day?<br>
        Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
    </p>
